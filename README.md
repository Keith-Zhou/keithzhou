## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Keith â€” a Computer Science graduate with a growing interest in full-stack development and machine learning.

Some of my earlier work was committed under my university GitHub account, so past contributions are not reflected on this profile. I'm currently rebuilding my GitHub activity here and will be sharing both personal and group projects going forward.

In the meantime, here are some group project repos I contributed to (more will be added once I regain access to my school GitHub account):

Thanks for visiting!
