## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Keith Zhou â€” a Computer Science graduate with a growing interest in full-stack development and machine learning.

Some of my earlier work was committed under my university GitHub account, so past contributions are not reflected on this profile. I'm currently rebuilding my GitHub activity here and will be sharing both personal and group projects going forward.

In the meantime, here are some group project repos I contributed to (more will be added once I regain access to my school GitHub account):

- [Study.AI](https://github.com/Keith-Zhou/cruzhacks24) â€“ Web application developed at UCSC CruzHacks 2024 to support personalized learning.

- [Turtle Recon](https://github.com/HershR/Turtle_Recon_Prototype) â€“ An underwater-themed Unity minigame where players control a turtle navigating ocean hazards and collecting tokens, developed to raise awareness about climate change.  
  Contributed to: Dialogue UI system, tutorial flow, and scene transitions â€” including features in previous builds and ongoing integration into the current version.  
  ðŸŽ® [Playable demo (early build)](https://apileofbacon.itch.io/green-city-manager)

> Other projects listed in my resume.

Thanks for visiting!
