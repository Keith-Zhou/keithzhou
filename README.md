## Welcome 👋

Hi, I'm Keith Zhou — a Computer Science graduate with a growing interest in full-stack development and machine learning.

Some of my earlier work was committed using my university GitHub account (`ksutjipt`), often in group projects hosted under teammates' repositories — so those contributions aren't reflected here. I'm currently rebuilding my GitHub activity under this profile and will be sharing both personal and group projects going forward.

In the meantime, here are some group project repos I contributed to (more will be added once I regain access to my school GitHub account):

- [Study.AI](https://github.com/Keith-Zhou/cruzhacks24) – Web application developed at UCSC CruzHacks 2024 to support personalized learning.

- Green City Manager - 🎮 [Playable demo (early build)](https://apileofbacon.itch.io/green-city-manager) – A Unity-based educational game simulating city planning with climate impact in mind. Players manage a city by placing buildings, adjusting policies, and maintaining citizen awareness and happiness. The objective is to reach carbon neutrality within 50 turns by raising environmental and political awareness while maintaining city stability.
  - Built as part of a prototype for Island Earth Odyssey (non-profit initiative).
  💡 Contributed to: Dialogue UI system, tutorial flow, and scene transitions — including features in previous builds and ongoing integration into the current version.

- [Turtle Recon](https://github.com/HershR/Turtle_Recon_Prototype) – An underwater-themed Unity minigame where players control a turtle navigating ocean hazards and collecting tokens, developed to raise awareness about climate change.
  - Built as part of a prototype for Island Earth Odyssey (non-profit initiative).
  💡 Contributed to: Dialogue UI, obstacle bundle, and terrain design.
