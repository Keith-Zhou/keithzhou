## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Keith Zhou â€” a Computer Science graduate with a growing interest in full-stack development and machine learning.

Some of my earlier work was committed under my university GitHub account, so past contributions are not reflected on this profile. I'm currently rebuilding my GitHub activity here and will be sharing both personal and group projects going forward.

In the meantime, here are some group project repos I contributed to (more will be added once I regain access to my school GitHub account):

- [Study.AI](https://github.com/Keith-Zhou/cruzhacks24) â€“ Web application developed at UCSC CruzHacks 2024 to support personalized learning.

- [Turtle Recon](https://github.com/HershR/Turtle_Recon_Prototype) â€“ Minigame developed in Unity to raise awareness about climate change.  
  ðŸ’¡ Contributed to: Dialogue UI system, tutorial flow, and scene transitions.

> Other projects listed in my resume.

Thanks for visiting!
